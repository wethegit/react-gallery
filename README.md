## Features

- Accessibility. Built with careful attention to focus management and assistive technology.
- Fully-customizable layouts, using CSS Custom Properties.
- Provides a custom React hook for accessing gallery data, state, updater functions, and more. Build anything on top of the existing gallery components!

## Getting started

### Install the package

```bash
npm install @wethegit/react-gallery
-or-
yarn add @wethegit/react-gallery
```

### Import the Components and‚Äîoptionally‚Äîthe hook.

```js
import {
  Gallery,
  GalleryMain,
  GalleryNav,
  GalleryPagination,
  useGallery,
} from "@wethegit/react-gallery"
```

### Import the base stylesheet

This is an optional step, but it's highly recommended to use the base styles as a starting point. The most straightforward way to do this is to import the stylesheet into your app directly from the `/node_modules/@wethegit/react-gallery/dist/` directory.

```jsx
// app.js

import "@wethegit/react-gallery/dist/main.css"
```

üí° Using a custom Webpack setup, you can configure an `@import` resolver to allow for something like `@import "~@wethegit/react-gallery"` to be written directly in your app or component's stylesheet. Check out Webpack's [css-loader docs](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/#import) for more information.

### Create a simple Gallery

The `<Gallery>` component is a React context provider, which gives all child components access to relevant data. All child components that need access to gallery data must live within a `<Gallery>`. Here's an example of a gallery, given the following contrived data `GALLERY_ITEMS`. This will be explained in detail shortly.

‚ö†Ô∏è Before continuing, make sure you have properly [imported the base stylesheet](#import-the-base-stylesheet) (if you intend to use it).

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// some-data.js

export const GALLERY_ITEMS = [
  { image: "/my-image-1.png", alt: "Description of image!", id: 131789 },
  { image: "/my-image-2.png", alt: "Description of image!", id: 235233 },
  { image: "/my-image-3.png", alt: "Description of image!", id: 987432 },
  { image: "/my-image-4.png", alt: "Description of image!", id: 768324 },
]
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
// your-gallery.js

import { GALLERY_ITEMS } from "./some-data"
import { Gallery, GalleryMain, GalleryNav, GalleryPagination } from "@wethegit/react-gallery"

const YourGallery = () => {
  return (
    <Gallery items={GALLERY_ITEMS}>

      <GalleryMain
        renderGalleryItem={({ item }) => (
          <img src={item.image} alt={item.alt} />
        )}
      />

      <GalleryNav direction={0}>‚¨ÖÔ∏è</GalleryNav>
      <GalleryNav direction={1}>‚û°Ô∏è</GalleryNav>

      <GalleryPagination
        renderPaginationItem={({ i }) => (
          <span>{i + 1}</span>
        )}
      />

    </Gallery>
  )
}

export default YourGallery
```

The first step is to give your data to the `<Gallery>` component via the `items` prop. At the very least, `items` is expected to be an Array. From there, you're free to arrange the child components this package provides as you see fit. Below is a brief description of each of the child components' usage. For a detailed breakdown of this component, jump ahead to the [Gallery](#gallery) section.

`<GalleryMain>` is the primary gallery view where your item data is rendered. It receives a render prop, `renderGalleryItem`, which exposes a few arguments you can use in the JSX you return: `item`, `i`, `activeIndex`, and `active`. For a detailed breakdown of this component, jump ahead to the [GalleryMain](#gallerymain) section.

We're using the `<GalleryNav>` component to define our "next" and "previous" buttons. These components receive a `direction` prop, which expects either a `1` or a `0`, and corresponds to the direction the gallery should move in when the button in question is clicked (where `0` maps to "previous", and `1` maps to "next"). For a detailed breakdown of this component, see the [GalleryNav](#gallerynav) section.

We're also using the `<GalleryPagination>` component here. If you're not familiar, "pagination" refers to what is often rendered as a set of "dots" below a gallery ‚Äî¬†but this can be _anything_. This component receives a render prop `renderPaginationItem`, which exposes a few arguments you can use in the JSX you return: `item`, `i`, `activeIndex`, and `active`. For a detailed breakdown of this component, jump ahead to the [GalleryPagination](#gallerypagination) section.

## Custom layouts

Assuming the base stylesheet is being used, the `<GalleryMain>` component renders as a CSS grid, with a single grid area to house the currently-active item. There are a number of CSS custom properties on the various gallery components, which will allow you to customize the look of the gallery. Most of these properties are used to calculate the horizontal positioning of the gallery items around the main grid cell, and can be adjusted to create many different layout variations. Remove the `transform` property of a `.gallery__item` entirely, and you'll get a traditional, stacked gallery.

| CSS custom property | Element where defined  | Default          | Description                                                                                                                     |

| loop         | Boolean  | false            | Allows for looping behavior ‚Äî¬†i.e. when the last gallery item is active, a user can navigate to the "next" slide, which will take them back to the start of the gallery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| onChange     | Function |                  | Function to run on gallery state update, as a result of a "next", "previous", or "pagination" action. [More information](#onchange) below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| startIndex   | Number   | 0                | The index of the gallery item that should be active to start.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| visibleRange | Number   | -1               | The number of gallery items "visible" to the left or right of the active one. This option adds a CSS class to all elements within this range, allowing for layout customization. The default value of `-1` specifies that all items are visible, while setting the value to `1` for example, would add the `"gallery__item--visible"` class those items within immediate proximity to the active item. |

#### `ariaLiveText`

Per the WAI-ARIA spec, browsers using assistive technology such as screen readers announce content within a DOM element containing the `aria-live` attribute, anytime it changes. The gallery component's default value for this prop is `"Item $i of $t."`. The variables `$i` and `$t` here correspond to "current index" and "total number of items", and will be replaced with those values when rendered. This level of customization is provided so that you can localize/translate your content with accuracy.

#### `onChange`

The `onChange` callback allows you to run code whenever the active gallery item changes. It receives a single Object as an argument, containing the following properties:

| Argument  | Type   | Description                                                |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| oldIndex  | Number | The index before the onChange function fired.              |
| newIndex  | Number | The index after the onChange function fires.               |
| direction | Number | Either `0` or `1`, mapping to previous/left or next/right. |

### &lt;GalleryMain&gt;

The primary gallery body. Must be used within a `<Gallery>`. Renders an unordered list (`<ul>`) of your gallery items.

#### Props:

| Prop              | Type     | Description                                                                                                     |

This render prop wraps its return value in a list item (`<li>`), and receives a handful of arguments:

| Argument    | Type    | Description                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| active      | Boolean | Whether the current item being iterated over is the active item.                                               |
| activeIndex | Number  | The index of the currently active gallery item.                                                                |

| renderNavItem | Function | Optional. For more control over rendering than the `children` prop would give you, you have the option to pass JSX to this render prop. [More information](#renderNavItem) below. |

#### `renderNavItem`

This render prop is a nice alternative to simply passing childern to the `<GalleryNav>`, as it provides you with a handful of arguments, as outlined below:

| Argument    | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| activeIndex | Number  | The index of the currently-active gallery item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| disabled    | Boolean | Whether the nav button is in its disabled state ‚Äî presumably from `<Gallery>` having its `loop` prop set to `false`. Note that the DOM node attributes `disabled` and `aria-disabled="true"` are already added to the rendered button; whereas the purpose of this argument is to allow you to render something different based on that disabled state, or write some other rendering code based on it. |

### &lt;GalleryPagination&gt;

Renders an unordered list (`<ul>`) of pagination items. Must be used within a `<Gallery>`.

#### Props:

| Prop                 | Type     | Description                                                                                                           |

| renderPaginationItem | Function | A render prop, returning the JSX to render for each pagination item. [More information](#renderpaginationitem) below. |

#### `renderPaginationItem`

This render prop wraps its return value in a list item (`<li>`) and a `<button>`, and receives a handful of arguments:

| Argument    | Type    | Description                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| active      | Boolean | Whether the current pagination item being iterated over corresponds to the active gallery item.                           |
| activeIndex | Number  | The index of the currently active gallery item.                                                                           |
| i           | Number  | The index of the current pagination item being iterated over.                                                             |
| item        | Any     | The current pagination item being iterated over, as defined by the Array fed to the `<Gallery>` component's `items` prop. |

## Accessibility

The gallery component handles tabbing, focus management, and live-region announcements out-of-the-box. All relevant patterns used in this component follow the guidelines for carousels as documented by the [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/).

That said, you must still code responsibly! Ensure that your gallery contents, nav buttons, and pagination items all have discernible text ‚Äî whether that be image `alt` text, or [visually-hidden](https://css-tricks.com/inclusively-hidden/) text intended for screen readers.

Regarding the ARIA-live text, check out the section on this gallery's [`ariaLiveText`](#arialivetext) prop.

## useGallery hook

### Advanced customization

As you can see above, many of the properties returned by the `useGallery` hook provide the lower-level functionality for the gallery itself. You can use this data to create any custom implementation you like, without having to worry too much about what's happening behind the scenes.

### Usage

Here's an example of a custom component that uses the `useGallery` hook to simply render a paragraph with some information about the gallery's current state:

```jsx
import { useGallery } from "@wethegit/react-gallery"

const GalleryInfo = () => {
  const { activeIndex, previousIndex, loop } = useGallery()

  return (
    <p>
      The gallery's current index is {activeIndex}, its last index was {previousIndex},
      and its <code>loop</code> prop is set to {loop}!
    </p>
  )
}

export default GalleryInfo
```
